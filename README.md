## About

The About page provides an introduction to who I am, my background, and my interests. It highlights my passion for coding and my journey as a developer.

## Skills

On the Skills page, you can find a comprehensive list of my technical skills and expertise. It showcases the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools that I'm proficient in.

## Projects

The Projects page showcases a selection of my notable projects. Each project comes with a brief description, details about the technologies used, and a link to the project's GitHub repository or live demo.

## Coding Statistics

To provide insights into my coding progress and achievements, I have implemented web scraping techniques. The website collects coding statistics from popular coding platforms such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode.

To accomplish this, I utilized Node.js, Express, and Cheerio. These technologies enable me to fetch data from the coding websites, parse the HTML structure, and extract the desired statistics. I created different APIs to serve the extracted data, and the portfolio website calls these APIs to display the coding statistics.

## Contact

The Contact page provides a means to get in touch with me. It includes a contact form where visitors can send me messages or inquiries. I am always open to collaboration, job opportunities, or any other inquiries related to my work.
You can find the live version of the portfolio after some final touches.
