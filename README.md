## About

The About page provides an introduction to who I am, my background, and my interests. It highlights my passion for coding and my journey as a developer.

## Skills

On the Skills page, you can find a comprehensive list of my technical skills and expertise. It showcases the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools that I'm proficient in.

## Projects

The Projects page showcases a selection of my notable projects. Each project comes with a brief description, details about the technologies used, and a link to the project's GitHub repository or live demo.

## Coding Statistics

To provide insights into my coding progress and achievements, I have implemented web scraping techniques. The website collects coding statistics from popular coding platforms such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode.

To accomplish this, I utilized Node.js, Express, and Cheerio. These technologies enable me to fetch data from the coding websites, parse the HTML structure, and extract the desired statistics. I created different APIs to serve the extracted data, and the portfolio website calls these APIs to display the coding statistics.

## Contact

The Contact page provides a means to get in touch with me. It includes a contact form where visitors can send me messages or inquiries. I am always open to collaboration, job opportunities, or any other inquiries related to my work.
You can find the live version of the portfolio after some final touches.

Thank you for visiting! ðŸ’–
